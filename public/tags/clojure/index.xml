      <description>Has been 3 weeks that I&amp;rsquo;m learning Clojure. Here I will dedicate myself to putting posts about what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of Clojure.
Beforehand I wanna make clear that this series is by the vision of a person that has never worked with a functional language and has never heard about LISP or his dialects. Keep in mind that the languages that I feel comfortable with (not expert) are Javascript, PHP, and Python.</description>
