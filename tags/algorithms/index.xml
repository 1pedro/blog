The first problem named &amp;ldquo;Binary Gap&amp;rdquo; consists in a way to determine the longest zero occurrences in a binary string. The problem gives us a number and we should convert that number to a binary string then find the biggest consecutive zero occurrences in that binary string.
This problem is classified as easy and I didn&amp;rsquo;t take too much time to solve it.</description></item></channel></rss>
