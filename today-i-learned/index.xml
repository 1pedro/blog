CSS Selector Specificity It&amp;rsquo;s a way of avoiding the use of !import directive and it&amp;rsquo;s quite simple:
Suppose that you have a CSS like this:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 div { background-color: white; } #box { background-color: red; } .box { background-color: black; } and this css code is applied to a HTML like this:</description></item><item><title>TIL: How to convert a integer (32 bit) to binary using bitwise and bit-shift</title><link>/blog/today-i-learned/til_how_to_convert_int_to_binary_using_bitwise_and_bit_shift/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2022 00:20:06 -0300</pubDate><guid>/blog/today-i-learned/til_how_to_convert_int_to_binary_using_bitwise_and_bit_shift/</guid><description>Today I was exercising some competitive programming problems using Codility. The first problem named &amp;ldquo;Binary Gap&amp;rdquo; consists in a way to determine the longest zero occurrences in a binary string. The problem gives us a number and we should convert that number to a binary string then find the biggest consecutive zero occurrences in that binary string.
This problem is classified as easy and I didn&amp;rsquo;t take too much time to solve it.</description></item><item><title>TIL: Git is not suitable for binary large files</title><link>/blog/today-i-learned/git_is_not_suitable_for_binary_large_files/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2022 02:02:06 -0300</pubDate><guid>/blog/today-i-learned/git_is_not_suitable_for_binary_large_files/</guid><description>Iâ€™d never thought about that until faced this problem. For me, git was the best option to keep track of file differences, either a text file or a binary file.
The Problem Today I&amp;rsquo;m facing a problem: I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to add PSD files to a git repository. That&amp;rsquo;s is not &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; but is a big mistake. If the PSD files are changed often you will end up with a large git repository.</description></item></channel></rss>
