The first problem named &amp;ldquo;Binary Gap&amp;rdquo; consists in a way to determine the longest zero occurrences in a binary string. The problem gives us a number and we should convert that number to a binary string then find the biggest consecutive zero occurrences in that binary string.
This problem is classified as easy and I didn&amp;rsquo;t take too much time to solve it.</description></item><item><title>TIL: Git is not suitable for binary large files</title><link>https://1pedro.github.io/blog/today-i-learned/git_is_not_suitable_for_binary_large_files/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2022 02:02:06 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://1pedro.github.io/blog/today-i-learned/git_is_not_suitable_for_binary_large_files/</guid><description>Iâ€™d never thought about that until faced this problem. For me, git was the best option to keep track of file differences, either a text file or a binary file.
The Problem Today I&amp;rsquo;m facing a problem: I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to add PSD files to a git repository. That&amp;rsquo;s is not &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; but is a big mistake. If the PSD files are changed often you will end up with a large git repository.</description></item></channel></rss>
